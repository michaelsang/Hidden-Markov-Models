Meets Specifications
I am really impressed with the amount of effort you've put into the project.
Give yourself a pat on the back! You deserve all the stars for your hardwork :star:

:tada: Finally, Congratulations on completing this project. You are one step closer to finishing your Nanodegree.
Wishing you good luck for all future projects :tada:

General Requirements
Includes HMM Tagger.ipynb displaying output for all executed cells
Includes HMM Tagger.html, which is an HTML copy of the notebook showing the output from executing all cells
All required files are included in the submission zip.

Submitted notebook has made no changes to test case assertions

The test cases are intact throughout the notebook. :white_check_mark:

Baseline Tagger Implementation
Emission count test case assertions all pass.

The emission counts dictionary has 12 keys, one for each of the tags in the universal tagset
"time" is the most common word tagged as a NOUN
Both test cases associated with emission_counts are passing:
1) The dictionary contains the required 12 keys.
2) time is the most common word and appropriately tagged as a noun.

Baseline MFC tagger passes all test case assertions and produces the expected accuracy using the universal tagset.

>95.5% accuracy on the training sentences
93% accuracy the test sentences
Good job! :thumbsup:
The accuracy on training sentences is 95.72%
Test sentence accuracy is 93.02%

Calculating Tag Counts
All unigram test case assertions pass

All test cases passed!

All bigram test case assertions pass

All test cases passed!

All start and end count test case assertions pass

The test cases for all three Tag Counting implementations (Unigram tagging, Bigram Tagging, Sequence Starting & Ending counts) are passing.

Basic HMM Tagger Implementation
All model topology test case assertions pass

Excellent work. You've implemented an appropriate topology for your HMM Tagger. :thumbsup:

Basic HMM tagger passes all assertion test cases and produces the expected accuracy using the universal tagset.

>97% accuracy on the training sentences
>95.5% accuracy the test sentences
Awesome! The final model attains the required training and test accuracies to pass this project. :clap:
